Whenever a new 'groundbreaking' technology is introduced, well before people understand it's capabilities or limitations, companies jump on it because they don't want to be left behind. I do not want to be working at a company where my product manager tells me i need to incorporate chatGPT without telling me how or why, but i see that in my future.
