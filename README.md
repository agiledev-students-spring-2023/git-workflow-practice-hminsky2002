## [ChatGPT Is About to Dump More Work on Everyone](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/chatgpt-ai-detector-machine-learning-technology-bureaucracy/672927/)
&nbsp;This article's content reminds me of the blockchain craze around 2017 that I barely remember. It seemed like everyone wanted to incorporate blockchain into their product without even knowing what blockchain technology was. Whenever a new 'groundbreaking' technology is introduced, well before people understand it's capabilities or limitations, companies jump on it because they don't want to be left behind. I do not want to be working at a company where my product manager tells me i need to incorporate chatGPT without telling me how or why, but i see that in my future.

&nbsp;The author discusses the concept of "hyperemployment", where new technologies have made it so that individuals are expected to be fully competent in fields that were once specialized. "Data dashboards and services make office workers part-time business analysts. On social media, many people are now de facto marketers and PR agents for their division and themselves." 
I'm reminded of a calvin and hobbes comic

This is a very interesting article that has definitely changed my view on ChatGPT and AI. ChatGPT is definitely cool and has cause AI to be the next big thing. This has led to greater investment and interest in AI from both companies, communities, and individuals. Even I have thought about steering towards AI. All of this stemmed from FOMO or fear of missing out. When companies develop an interest in new technologies, it becomes almost a standard that workers have to pursue. That might be inevitable when companies are the one with all the power in this relationship. However, I think its noteworthy to stop and think about the extra work and the why. A better understanding of what you are doing and how that would lead to success is much more valuable than aimlessly chasing an illusion. Overall, the idea of "hyperemployment" and the implications it has are something I would definitely ponder about going into the future in my career.

<p>I find the "hyperemployment" bit to be be very interesting, and it sort of addresses the concerns I had about the article I wrote about. It would be huge pain if something as useful as this AI only made work harder for software engineers. Ideally ChatGPT would be used for a programmer's busywork and maybe as a more efficient Google search when one has questions relating to algorithms and runtime. However, I also totally see the fears you wrote about in the first paragraph to be a frustrating possiblity.</p>
