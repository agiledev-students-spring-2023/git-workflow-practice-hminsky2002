## [ChatGPT Is About to Dump More Work on Everyone](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/chatgpt-ai-detector-machine-learning-technology-bureaucracy/672927/)
&nbsp;This article's content reminds me of the blockchain craze around 2017 that I barely remember. It seemed like everyone wanted to incorporate blockchain into their product without even knowing what blockchain technology was. Whenever a new 'groundbreaking' technology is introduced, well before people understand it's capabilities or limitations, companies jump on it because they don't want to be left behind. I do not want to be working at a company where my product manager tells me i need to incorporate chatGPT without telling me how or why, but i see that in my future.

&nbsp;The author discusses the concept of "hyperemployment", where new technologies have made it so that individuals are expected to be fully competent in fields that were once specialized. "Data dashboards and services make office workers part-time business analysts. On social media, many people are now de facto marketers and PR agents for their division and themselves." 
I'm reminded of a calvin and hobbes comic

<p>I find the "hyperemployment" bit to be be very interesting, and it sort of addresses the concerns I had about the article I wrote about. It would be huge pain if something as useful as this AI only made work harder for software engineers. Ideally ChatGPT would be used for a programmer's busywork and maybe as a more efficient Google search when one has questions relating to algorithms and runtime. However, I also totally see the fears you wrote about in the first paragraph to be a frustrating possiblity.</p>
